- `returnItem(Member member, Item item)`: Return a book or journal.
- `recordTransaction(Transaction transaction)`: Record a transaction in the register.

### 2. **Class: Item (Abstract)**

- `author`: Author of the item.
- `publicationDate`: Date of publication.

**Methods**:
- `getDetails()`: Get details of the item.

### 3. **Class: Book (Inherits from Item)**

### 4. **Class: Journal (Inherits from Item)**
This class represents a journal in the library.

**Attributes**:
- `issueNumber`: Issue number of the journal.
- `volumeNumber`: Volume number of the journal.

**Methods**:

### 5. **Class: Member (Abstract)**
This abstract class will serve as a base class for Student and Faculty.

### 7. **Class: Faculty (Inherits from Member)**

Integration with Existing Classes
Library Class:

The Library class will now have a reference to the Librarian object.

The methods for adding books, journals, members, issuing items, returning items, and recording transactions will be delegated to the Librarian class.

Item, Book, and Journal Classes:

No changes needed. These classes will remain as they are.

Member, Student, and Faculty Classes:

No changes needed. These classes will remain as they are.

Transaction Class:

No changes needed. This class will remain as it is.
